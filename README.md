# Graphs of voltage-current characteristics for ITMO Research 

Simple Python scripts, that will transform Forward-Reverse voltage-current characteristics into more readable and comprehensible DataFrame to work with and
then plot those characteristics one by one using different colors and plot-line styles in order to distinguish between different graphs.

## Plot for forward-reverse voltage-current char. data:

*Here is the finished plot that will be used in documentation:*
