# Graphs of voltage-current characteristics for ITMO Reaserch 

Simple Python scripts, that will transform Forward-Reverse voltage-current characteristics into more readable and comprehensible DataFrame to work with and
then plot those characteristics one by one using different colors and plot-line styles in order to distinguish between different graphs.
